<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

everytime I go to airport, I always get confused and having a hard time tring to find where everything is. The crowed, the traffic and people rushing or slowing down it makes using airport not fun and inconvenient. Thus, I came up with the idea of what would be the easiest way to go about your flight without stressing out how to get there. 

Here's why:
* People will spend time on enjoying thier flight rather than focusing on how to finding everything.
* Perhaps you get to enjoy a meal or a drink, or chatting up a stranger instead of working about your flight.
* this app is gonna be on your phone, and you gonna be on your phone listening to your favorite songs, mine as well checking this app out is better than trying to find someone help you find things, cause people at the airport do not want to talk.
